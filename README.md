# geometry
This program is a C++ implementation of the Loop subdivision algorithm, which is used to subdivide a given mesh into a finer mesh.

The program reads in a directed edge data structure from a text file, subdivides the mesh, and outputs the resulting mesh in a new text file.

The input file contains the number of vertices, the number of triangles, and the number of edges in the mesh, followed by the indices of the vertices for each triangle, and the indices of the two vertices for each edge.

The output file contains the same information as the input file, but with the subdivided mesh.

The program is written in C++ and should compile and run with any standard C++ compiler.
I used GCC to compile the program and it can run on any linux system.
